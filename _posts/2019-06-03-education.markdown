An article which I co-authored with Ansh Joshi and Deepak Dhariwal about the issues India needs to address to reform its education system:<!--more-->

*The education system, with terrible teaching that programs Indians to focus on tests, must change and put a focus on learning instead.*

In 2018, Apple’s co-founder, Steve Wozniak, visited India and made some fascinating observations on the country. He was humble enough to admit he knew little about India, but he remarked that he did not see “big advances in tech companies” in the country. He blamed the culture, which he saw as “one of success based upon academic excellence” and “having a good job.”

Wozniak observed that Indians are a lot like Singaporeans in this regard. They study, work hard and get an MBA. They may buy a Mercedes, “but where is the creativity?” Wozniak takes the view that creativity gets lost when behavior becomes too predictable and structured.

His observation on India might be harsh, but it is not far from the truth. Hard figures back Wozniak’s argument. In 2017, the UN’s World Intellectual Property Indicators (WIPO) reported that foreign nationals dominated the patents granted in India. They accounted for more than 85% of the newly-filed ones. According to Oxford Economics, Indian startups lack technological innovation and mimic successful businesses that begin elsewhere. When it comes to big players, only one Indian company, Hindustan Unilever, notably a subsidiary of the London-based Unilever group, made it to the top 75 in the Forbes list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies.

Just north of the Himalayas, another story is emerging. A country with more than a billion people is now at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. While China has built, perfected and scaled up its own high-speed rail technology, India’s high-speed version will run on 20th-century engines built through Japan’s tech know-how and its financial generosity. While China is innovating in quantum communication and computing, India is taking symbolic baby steps by awarding paltry sums that are unlikely to lead to significant results. And while Chinese startups account for 26% percent of the world’s unicorns, Indian startups form a mere 4%. Is this because Indians are less innovative than the Chinese?
