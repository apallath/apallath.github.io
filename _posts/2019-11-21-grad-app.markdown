Resources which I found to be really useful for graduate applications<!--more-->:

# General advice
[Advice for PhD Program Applications - pgbovine.net](http://www.pgbovine.net/grad-school-app-tips.htm)

# Advice for writing good statements
[Writing Your Graduate School Application Essay - CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/gcc/handouts-and-resources/handouts/grad-app-sop.pdf):
The use of examples to separate well-written and poorly-written statements is why this handout is gold.

[Statement of Purpose Guidelines - MIT](http://web.mit.edu/msrp/myMSRP/docs/Statement%20of%20purpose%20guidelines.pdf)

[Writing the Statement of Purpose - Berkeley](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/)
