Hi, I'm Akash. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a PhD student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I am a member of the [Patel Research Group](http://patelgroup.seas.upenn.edu) at the [Penn Institute for Computational Science](https://pics.upenn.edu) since November 2019. My research interests include the development and application of enhanced molecular simulation methods for solving problems in computational biology, and the application of deep learning models to solve problems in the same field. I currently study protein hydration and interactions using molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced umbrella sampling.

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) in August 2019 with a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. My undergraduate research at [IITGN](https://iitgn.ac.in/), [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) and [JAIST](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/) included the study of interfacial fluctuations using molecular dynamics, heat transport in amorphous materials using molecular dynamics, performance benchmarking for density functional theory calculations, and also some theoretical computer science research.
