Hi, I'm Akash. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a PhD student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I am a member of the [Patel Research Group](http://patelgroup.seas.upenn.edu) at the [Penn Institute for Computational Science](https://pics.upenn.edu) since November 2019. My research interests are protein hydration and interactions, molecular simulation method development and applied machine learning.

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) in August 2019 with a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. My undergraduate research included study of interfacial fluctuations using molecular dynamics, heat transport in amorphous materials using molecular dynamics, and performance benchmarking for density functional theory calculations.
